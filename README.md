# Computer Science 340 Software Engineering Project

This project was within semester long class where we were given an unoptimized application with no server, instead referencing FakeData.
Over the course of the semester, I implemented
- Model View Presenter Pattern
- Generic Types
- Tests using Jest and Mockito
- Dependency Injection
- The entire backend using Amazon Web services (S3, SQS, Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway)
- Template Pattern
- and more

I've only included the source files for convenience
